OOP Concepts ðŸš€

This repository contains step-by-step C# console projects demonstrating the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Encapsulation â€“ hiding data and controlling access through methods/properties

Abstraction â€“ exposing only essential features while hiding implementation details

Inheritance â€“ reusing and extending behavior from parent classes

Polymorphism â€“ the ability for the same method call to behave differently depending on the object

Each concept is implemented in its own demo project, with code, explanations, and practice questions.
